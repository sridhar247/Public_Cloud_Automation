

   1.  Create an OVA file from an ESX template. Save or copy the OVA file to you PC.

   2.  Login to the AWS portal ( Account info )

         On the front AWS page in the "Storage & Content Delivery" section:
           - Select the S3 service.
           - In the S3 bucket, select the "vz-sandbox-images" directory.
           - Select "Actions --> Upload" and a new window will be launched.
           - Select "Add Files" and an explorer window will be launched.
           - Navigate to and select the OVA file(s)
           - From the "Upload" window select "Start Upload".

   3.  Once the image has been copied to the AWS S3 bucket, you have to run the import-image command via the AWSCLI utility.

        On the pc with the AWSCLI utility, start a command prompt and issue the following commands.
         
         cd C:\program files\Amazon\AWSCLI

         aws ec2 import-image --cli-input-json "{  \"Description\": \"VZ Sandbox Linux RHEL6 OVA\", \"DiskContainers\": [ { \"Description\": \"First CLI task\", \"UserBucket\": { \"S3Bucket\": \"vz-sandbox-images\", \"S3Key\" : \"aws_sandbox_rhel6_template.ova\" } } ]}"

   
               Description:  Name of image you are importing  IE: "VZ Sandbox Linux RHEL6 OVA"
               S3Key:  Name of templates .ova file (file you copied up to S3 bucket)  IE: aws_sandbox_rhel6_template.ova

          Here is an example output from the import-image command.

            {
                "Status": "active",
                "Description": "VZ Sandbox Windows 2012R2 OVA",
                "Progress": "2",
                "SnapshotDetails": [
                    {
                        "UserBucket": {
                            "S3Bucket": "vz-sandbox-images",
                            "S3Key": "aws_sandbox_windows2012r2_template.ova"
                        },
                        "DiskImageSize": 0.0
                    }
                ],
                "StatusMessage": "pending",
                "ImportTaskId": "import-ami-fhb82vmc"
            }

 

             Note: The ImportTaskId will be needed if you want to review the status of the import.

    To monitor the status of the import-image job, use the following AWSCLI command.
 
    aws ec2 describe-import-image-tasks --cli-input-json "{ \"ImportTaskIds\": [\"import-ami-ffzmgbdc\"], \"NextToken\": \"abc\", \"MaxResults\": 10 } "
 
   ImportTaskIds:  The import-ami-ID can be found in the output from the import-image command.

      Here is an example output from the describe-import-image-tasks command. Job "Progress" will show "complete" once finished.

 
            {
                "ImportImageTasks": [
                    {
                        "Status": "active",
                        "Description": "VZ Sandbox Windows 2012R2 OVA",
                        "Progress": "39",
                        "SnapshotDetails": [
                            {
                                "UserBucket": {
                                    "S3Bucket": "vz-sandbox-images",
                                    "S3Key": "aws_sandbox_windows2012r2_template.ova"
                                },
                                "DiskImageSize": 10293606912.0,
                                "Format": "VMDK"
                            }
                        ],
                        "StatusMessage": "updating",
                        "ImportTaskId": "import-ami-fhb82vmc"
                    }
                ]
            }

 

To find out the AMI ID property to use when creating an instance, login to the AWS portal and navigate to the following location.

            -  Login to the AWS portal ( Account info )
         From the front AWS page in the "Compute" section:

           - Select the EC2 service.
           - Select "AMIs" in the Images section.
           - Select the AMI Name from the import and you'll find the AMI ID.

Make sure you document the AMI ID for this import because it is required if you want to use this image in an API start instance call.
